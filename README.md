# CEG4110-HW-02
This is the second homework project assignment for my CEG 4110 class of my Senior Year at Wright State University. 

The main features of the application are that there are two different clock displays featuring an analog clock and a text clock. Along with this is a control panel to adjust the time yourself. When you hit any of the buttons on the control panel it will/should update the time and date on both clocks. Figure 0.1 shows a design of what the app looks like when you open it up.

The application is supposed to display the time and date with the analog clock as it is running, then in the digital view display the clock time and date as well. In addition, when you click a button it is supposed to change the time for both views but in the current state, the app will close when any button is clicked.  
This homework assignment was very difficult to work on. Specifically, in dealing with having to implement the MVC (Model View Controller) Design Pattern. It was something new that I had to try and learn, and was very difficult for me to take from class and implement into the assignment here. My application is not fully complete, and I would not recommend it to be worthwhile to be used until it is complete. I hope to work more on the assignment and later get it up and running properly. 

Looking at Figure 0.2 shows a UML diagram to help with showing the design of the MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern.
